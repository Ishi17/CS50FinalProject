# Recipe Recommender
#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/xWPtasgJyPo
#### Description:
I built a website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and theMealsDB API. In this website you can input the category of food you want, the cuisine and the main ingredient to get recipe suggestions. After that, you can filter
the recipes listed with the ingredients you have at home. When you click on a recipe, it gives you all the details of it, including instructions, the real article and a video. 

Please ignore the restuarant section of the website, it is still work in progress.
